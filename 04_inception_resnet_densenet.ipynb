        "In this tutorial, we will implement and discuss variants of modern CNN architectures.\n",
        "There have been many different architectures been proposed over the past few years.\n",
        "Some of the most impactful ones, and still relevant today, are the following: [GoogleNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842)/Inception architecture (winner of ILSVRC 2014), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (winner of ILSVRC 2015), and [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) (best paper award CVPR 2017).\n",
        "All of them were state-of-the-art models when being proposed, and the core ideas of these networks are the foundations for most current state-of-the-art architectures.\n",
        "Thus, it is important to understand these architectures in detail and learn how to implement them.\n",
        "This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of Amsterdam.\n",

        "Instead of modeling the difference between layers, DenseNet considers residual connections as a possible way to reuse features across layers, removing any necessity to learn redundant feature maps.\n",
        "If we go deeper into the network, the model learns abstract features to recognize patterns.\n",
        "However, some complex patterns consist of a combination of abstract features (e.g. hand, face, etc.\n",
        "), and low-level features (e.g. edges, basic color, etc.).\n",
        "To find these low-level features in the deep layers, standard CNNs have to learn copy such feature maps, which wastes a lot of parameter complexity.\n",
        "DenseNet provides an efficient way of reusing features by having each convolution depends on all previous input features, but add only a small amount of filters to it.\n",
        "See the figure below for an illustration (figure credit - [Hu et al. ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993)):\n",

        "The last layer, called the transition layer, is responsible for reducing the dimensionality of the feature maps in height, width, and channel size.\n",
        "Although those technically break the identity backpropagation, there are only a few in a network so that it doesn't affect the gradient flow much.\n",
        "\n",
        "We split the implementation of the layers in DenseNet into three parts: a `DenseLayer`, and a `DenseBlock`, and a `TransitionLayer`.\n",
        "The module `DenseLayer` implements a single layer inside a dense block.\n",
        "It applies a 1x1 convolution for dimensionality reduction with a subsequential 3x3 convolution.\n",
        "The output channels are concatenated to the originals and returned.\n",
        "Note that we apply the Batch Normalization as the first layer of each block.\n",
        "This allows slightly different activations for the same features to different layers, depending on what is needed.\n",
